This is a scavenger hunt or Capture the Flag (CTF) game that accompanied a 2024 Halloween party.

It uses a HID USB (BadUSB) based on the ATMEGA32U4 Arduino board to deliver a keystroke payload, which pulls a PowerShell script I created to leave clues around the Windows directory.
This CTF requires very little technical background to play and also includes increasingly difficult puzzles after SSH-ing into a Linux cloud server.
Contestants are given a unique keyword that they must remember to SSH into the server and complete the scavenger hunt.

Feel free to take a look around and offer new ideas or suggestions for future CTF projects.
